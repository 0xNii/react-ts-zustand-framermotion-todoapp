# React + TypeScript + Zustand + Framer Motion Todo App

A React.js Todo app inspired by [TODO MVC](https://todomvc.com/) — built with a contemporary tech stack and 
clean design.

This project serves as a learning resource for building apps with React and TypeScript, managing state using Zustand,
and adding delightful animations with Framer Motion. The codebase is well-structured and easy to follow for beginners
and intermediate developers alike.
